# Algorithm_Visualizer
A simple visualizer for some path-finding algorithms. This is my first time building a GUI and this project helped
me learn a lot about how GUI building with tkinter works. 

# How to use
-Make sure you have Python3 installed   
-Download the files and extract them into a folder. Open a terminal/command prompt in the directory and run the command "python3 Visualizer.py"   
-Open the "Draw" menu to draw walls and set start and end points. Select "A-Star" for and a-star search or "BFS" for a breadth first search when you are ready.  
-Click "Clear" to completely clear the window or click "Reset Search" to keep your set walls and points but reset for another search or for editing the current search
