# Algorithm_Visualizer
A simple visualizer for some path-finding algorithms. This is my first time building a GUI and this project helped
me learn a lot about how GUI building with tkinter works. 

# How to use
-Make sure you have Python3 installed
-Download the files and extract them into a folder. Open a terminal/command prompt in the directory and run the command "python3 Visualizer.py"
-Open the "Draw" menu to draw walls and set start and end points. Click start when you are ready.
